# Feed Reader Testing
---

## Get Started
All the code is available by [clicking here.](https://github.com/ZiyadMobarak/Feed-Reader-Testing)
You can access the running website through the following link:
https://ziyadmobarak.github.io/Feed-Reader-Testing/

**Note: you might face an error if opened online due to some security reasons. Therefore, I prefer you test it locally.**

##### How To Open The Website Locally
There are two ways to host the code locally on your machine:-
- Method#1: Download source code and open main page as follows:
  1. Go to https://github.com/ZiyadMobarak/Feed-Reader-Testing
  2. Click on **"Clone or download"**
  3. Click on **"Download ZIP"**
  4. Go the folder where you've downloaded the source code.
  5. Unzip the files
  6. Open **"index.html"**
  7. Start using the application :)


- Method#2: Download source code and host locally (for MAC users only):-
  1. Start a terminal session on your machine
  2. Type in the following command to start up your Local Apache Server:
     `sudo apachectl start`
  3. Do steps 1-5 from method#1
  4. Copy all the source code from the current path to the following path: _/Library/WebServer/Documents_
  5. Open any browser on your machine.
  6. Go to the following url "**localhost**". Simply type _localhost_ in the url section and click enter.
  7. Start using the application :)


## About The Website
Once you open the website, it will initially request for feeds from Udacity. However, other feeds won't be requested until it is specified from the menu list, then it will be retrieved.

All tests will be ran automatically and the test results will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Note that the website is functioning properly, so all the appeared test will be passed (_green_).

## The Project Rubric
The following requirements have been tested:-
- **Test Coverage:** All required tests were implemented, independent from each other and all of them passed (_green_).
- **Documentation:** I've followed the known conventions when writing my code. I've documented everything may not be clear to you in the code. Finally I've wrote this _README_ that hopefully will help you in evaluating the project.

## About The Code
I must acknowledge that code is written with the help of _udacity_ videos available in _advanced JavaScript Course._

The code is well documented, and hopefully, you won't face an issue going through the code.
